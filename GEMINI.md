# Project Gemini: English Learning Tools

## 🎯 Business Objective
The goal is to revolutionize English vocabulary acquisition by replacing rote memorization with **Contextual Immersion**. By leveraging the **FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler)** algorithm, the app identifies exactly when a word is about to be forgotten. Instead of isolated flashcards, it uses **Google Gemini AI** to weave these specific words into a coherent, level-appropriate story, ensuring the user learns how words function in real-world scenarios.

## 🧠 Core Business Logic: The "Immersion Cycle"
1.  **Retention Analysis**: The system scans the database for "Due" words (stability-based calculation via FSRS).
2.  **Personalized Scaffolding**: Users choose their learning target (e.g., 50% familiar review, 50% new challenges from CEFR B2 level).
3.  **Contextual Synthesis**: Gemini AI generates a story using the exact 30-word set, wrapping target terms in `<mark>` tags for focus.
4.  **Multi-Modal Reinforcement**: Users listen to pronunciations (TTS), read the story, and then perform a **Batch Review** where they rate their recall difficulty.
5.  **Memory Update**: Ratings are fed back into the FSRS algorithm, shifting the next review date scientifically.

## 🏗 Architectural Overview
-   **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router) for high-performance React rendering.
-   **Backend**: tRPC for type-safe communication between the client and the database.
-   **ORM**: Prisma with PostgreSQL, utilizing a scientifically-optimized `Word` model.
-   **AI**: Google Gemini (Default: **gemini-3-flash-preview**) via the central `callGemini` utility.
-   **Offline Engine**: Local LanguageTool HTTP server (port 8081).
-   **Security**: Tiered protection via tRPC Middleware and Global `AuthGuard`.

## 📅 Development Roadmap & Status

## [x] Task 1: T3 Stack Setup & Database Modeling
-   Initialized Project with Next.js, Prisma, Tailwind, tRPC.
-   Defined the `Word` model with FSRS fields.

## [x] Task 2: Data Seeding
-   Processed Oxford 5000 vocabulary data into the database.

## [x] Task 3: The tRPC Router & FSRS Selection Logic
-   Implemented complex selection logic: prioritizing due words + oversampling new words.

## [x] Task 4: UI & TTS (Frontend)
-   Built interactive word selection, display components, and native TTS.

## [x] Task 5: Gemini Story Generation
-   Implemented `generateStory` mutation with CEFR level enforcement.

## [x] Task 6: Progress Tracking (FSRS Review)
-   Connected frontend ratings to the `ts-fsrs` algorithm.

## [x] Task 8: Grammar Correction Tool
-   [x] **8.1: Unified Analysis Router (tRPC)**: Design `grammar.ts` with support for online/offline modes.
-   [x] **8.2: Split-Pane UI Implementation**: Editor (Left) and Results (Right: List, Preview, Summary).
-   [x] **8.3: Online Engine (Gemini 3)**: Deep contextual analysis and "Quick Fix" suggestions.
-   [x] **8.4: Offline Engine (Local)**: High-performance checking via LanguageTool integration.
-   [x] **8.5: Interactive Highlights**: Render clickable highlights with Tooltips and text replacement.
-   [x] **8.6: Error Analytics**: Dedicated summary tab with visual metrics.

## [x] Task 9: Unified Architecture & Security Layer
-   [x] **9.1: Centralized AI Utility**: Created `src/server/lib/gemini.ts` using `@google/genai`.
-   [x] **9.2: Global Auth Guard**: Implemented `AuthGuard` to protect all routes in web mode.
-   [x] **9.3: PASSKEY Protocol**: Server-side tRPC middleware with "Punitive Delay" (2s) for failed attempts.
-   [x] **9.4: Environment Awareness**: Automatic UI adaptation for `local` vs. `web` environments.

## [ ] Task 7: Advanced Analytics & Dashboard (Planned)
-   [ ] Visualization of learning progress (Retention rate, Stability growth).
-   [ ] Heatmap of daily study sessions.
